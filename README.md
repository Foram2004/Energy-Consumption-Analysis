🌍 World Energy Consumption Analysis (WECA) <br>
A Comprehensive Analysis of Global Energy Trends Before and After Major World Events <br>

📋 Executive Summary <br>
World Energy Consumption Analysis (WECA) is an in-depth research project examining global energy consumption patterns with particular focus on the impacts of two major global events: the 2008-09 Economic Crisis and the 2019-20 COVID-19 Pandemic. Our analysis reveals critical insights about energy consumption trends, renewable energy adoption, and the resilience of global energy systems. <br>

🚨 Key Finding <br>
The COVID-19 pandemic caused global energy consumption to drop by -4%, twice the impact of the 2008 economic crisis, highlighting the unprecedented nature of the pandemic's effect on global energy systems.<br>
